This gives the best opportunity for the developer to learn how to not create that defect in the future. Prevention is much cheaper than detection and repair. Long cycle times here indicate poor test architecture that will reduce the team’s ability to improve development."

They are responsible for how it is built and feel the consequences of building it the wrong way. They eat their own dog food. Ownership can be destroyed by either telling them how to work or by outsourcing production support to another team. If they lack full ownership, the quality will always suffer."

We make them responsible for the outcomes, and we reduce the batch size of everything so that things happen more frequently. We integrate rapidly because it improves the feedback loop.
