If I’m using a back end for front end pattern, the UI and the service should absolutely be on the same team. Otherwise, the dependency drag for implementing any change will result in glacial delivery. If I also need the capability of tracking account transactions, I can easily assign that to another team and allow them to develop that solution independently.
