The new methodology with story points, daily standup, and sprints now reigns, but outcomes haven’t changed. Next, you talk about the “agile mindset” while Scrum Masters report monthly on how much “velocity” has increased. At the team level, the labels have changed, but the processes are the same. Possibly there is less design, but you don’t design solutions in “Agile”. They just “emerge”, right?"

You saw a framework that was popular and bought it without understanding the underlying principles. However, frameworks are solutions that worked for someone else in their context, not yours, and no drive-by “transformation” will result in anything except loss revenue, frustration, and low satisfaction from both customers and employees. For real change to happen, it needs to be ingrained into the culture. Culture and mindset change requires behavior change. At the team level, we do this with constructive constraints and rapid feedback."
