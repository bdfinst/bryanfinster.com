## GatsbyJS V2


NOTE: Take a look at [gatsby-advanced-starter](https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-advanced-starter) if you prefer building UI from scratch and/or only interested in fundamental features.

You can also visit [my personal blog](https://vagr9k.me) if you want to see a fully implemented blog based on this starter.

## Getting Started

Install this starter (assuming [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/) is installed and updated) by running from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby new YourProjectName https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

Or you can fork the project, make your changes there and merge new features when needed.

Alternatively:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter YourProjectName # Clone the project
cd YourProjectname
rm -rf .git # So you can have your own changes stored in VCS.
npm install # or yarn install
npm run develop # or gatsby develop
```

## Configuration

Edit the export object in `data/SiteConfig`:

```js
module.exports = {
  siteTitle: "Gatsby Material Starter", // Site title.
  siteTitleShort: "GM Starter", // Short site title for homescreen (PWA). Preferably should be under 12 characters to prevent truncation.
  siteTitleAlt: "GatsbyJS Material Starter", // Alternative site title for SEO.
  siteLogo: "/logos/logo-1024.png", // Logo used for SEO and manifest.
  siteUrl: "https://vagr9k.github.io", // Domain of your website without pathPrefix.
  pathPrefix: "/gatsby-material-starter", // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-material-starter/.
  fixedFooter: false, // Whether the footer component is fixed, i.e. always visible
  siteDescription: "A GatsbyJS stater with Material design in mind.", // Website description used for RSS feeds/meta description tag.
  siteRss: "/rss.xml", // Path to the RSS file.
  siteFBAppID: "1825356251115265", // FB Application ID for using app insights
  siteGATrackingID: "UA-47311644-4", // Tracking code ID for google analytics.
  disqusShortname: "https-vagr9k-github-io-gatsby-material-starter", // Disqus shortname.
  dateFromFormat: "YYYY-MM-DD", // Date format used in the frontmatter.
  dateFormat: "DD/MM/YYYY", // Date format for display.
  userName: "Material User", // Username to display in the author segment.
  userTwitter: "", // Optionally renders "Follow Me" in the UserInfo segment.
  userLocation: "North Pole, Earth", // User location to display in the author segment.
  userAvatar: "https://api.adorable.io/avatars/150/test.png", // User avatar to display in the author segment.
  userDescription:
    "Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs. Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different dogs for different people.", // User description to display in the author segment.
  // Links to social profiles/projects you want to display in the author segment/navigation bar.
  userLinks: [
    {
      label: "GitHub",
      url: "https://github.com/Vagr9K/gatsby-material-starter",
      iconClassName: "fa fa-github"
    },
    {
      label: "Twitter",
      url: "https://twitter.com/Vagr9K",
      iconClassName: "fa fa-twitter"
    },
    {
      label: "Email",
      url: "mailto:vagr9k@gmail.com",
      iconClassName: "fa fa-envelope"
    }
  ],
  copyright: "Copyright © 2019. Material User" // Copyright string for the footer of the website and RSS feed.
};
```

You can also optionally set `pathPrefix`:

```js
module.exports = {
  // Note: it must *not* have a trailing slash.
  pathPrefix: "/gatsby-material-starter" // Prefixes all links. For cases when deployed to example.github.io/gatsby-material-starter/.
};
```

NOTE: `user*`, `disqusShortname` and `copyright` are optional and won't render if omitted.

WARNING: Make sure to edit `static/robots.txt` to include your domain for the sitemap!

## NetlifyCMS

First of all, make sure to edit `static/admin/config.yml` and add your [GitHub/GitLab/NetlifyId credentials](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/authentication-backends/):

```yml
backend:
  name: github # Refer to https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/authentication-backends/ for auth backend list and instructions
  branch: master # Branch to update
  repo: vagr9k/gatsby-material-starter # Repo for pushing new commits. Make sure to replace with your repo!
```

You can visit `/admin/` after and will be greeted by a login dialog (depending on the auth provider you ave chosen above).

For NetlifyCMS specific issues visit the [official documentation](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/intro/).

## Theming

Edit `src/layout/theme.scss` to suit your needs.
You can use [Material color palette](https://react-md.mlaursen.com/customization/colors) provided by React-MD.

```css
@import "~react-md/src/scss/react-md";
$md-primary-color: $md-grey-400;
$md-secondary-color: $md-red-800;
$md-tertiary-color: $md-grey-300;
```
