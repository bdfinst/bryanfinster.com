    the techniques for helping product teams worldwide learn the principles
    and practices of continuous delivery. Developed training and presentations to help
    teams with every aspect of delivery, from idea to production. Worked with Platform
    leadership to design changes to the platform to reinforce good practices, improve
    security and compliance, and improve the developer experience.'
  highlights:
  - Lead the cross-organizational effort to standardize delivery metrics definitions
    and usage which resulted in a shared understanding of how to effectively measure efficiency,
    effectiveness, and sustainability of software delivery.
  - Worked to standardize testing pattern definitions and recommend testing practices.
    This helped scale knowledge transfer and sharing of techniques across the enterprise
    for effective testing.
  - Worked to build enterprise communities of interest to improve cross organizational
    sharing on techniques for improving outcomes.
  - Developed self-help playbooks for the common issues teams face when migrating to a
    continuous delivery development flow. These playbooks were a force multiplier that allowed
    the Dojo team to focus on helping with more complicated problems while providing actionable
    improvement journeys for teams starting the journey.
  - Designed a team "Coaching as a Service" tool that combined pipeline delivery metrics and
    "ways of working" survey results to guide teams to improvement playbooks.

    by certifying senior engineers who have demonstrated through improved delivery
    metrics to have improved team outcomes.

  - Created the first testing terms and patterns guide to help teams learn to test.
  - Led the first team focusing on CD to uncover the behaviors, practices, and skills needed. This resulted in growing a typical team from quarterly or less delivery to nearly one delivery per day per developer over the course of 9 months.

  - Automated the source branching process to reduce the time to branch more than 800 SVN repositories and create the Ant Hill Pro build pipelines from 48 hours to 90 minutes. This saved over 96 hours of effort for each feature branch for 400 development teams and made branching a self service activity for those teams.
  - Changed the branching working model for the area to reduce the number of semi-permanent branches from more than 400 to 2. This enabled the dissolution of the source management team.
