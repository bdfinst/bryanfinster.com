  summary: 'Responsible for integrating over 400 feature branches for the quarterly delivery of Walmart’s global warehouse management system. Given responsibility for developing better processes that would make the team unnecessary.'
  highlights:
  - Automated the source branching process to reduce the time to branch more than 800 SVN repositories and create the Ant Hill Pro build pipelines from 48 hours to 90 minutes. This saved over 96 hours of effort for each feature branch for 400 development teams and made branching a self service activity for those teams.
  - Changed the branching working model for the area to reduce the number of semi-permanent branches from more than 400 to 2. This enabled the dissolution of the source management team.
