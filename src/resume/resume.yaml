  position: Product Owner, Lead Value Stream Architect

  startDate: '2018-01'
  endDate: ''
  summary: 'Founded the Walmart DevOps Dojo. Responsible for defining the techniques for helping product
    teams worldwide learn the principles and practices of continuous delivery. Developed workshops, presentations,
    and playbooks to help teams with every aspect of improving the flow of delivery from idea to production
    and operations. Worked with other CD Platform leads to design changes to the platform to reinforce good
    practices, discourage poor practices, improve security and compliance, and improve developer experience.'
  highlights:
  - Lead the cross-organizational effort to standardize delivery metrics definitions
    and usage to provide teams with the insights needed to identify and remove
    delivery constraints. This resulted in reduced duplication of effort and better understanding at the enterprise
    level of what and how to measure delivery performance.
  - Core contributor to the team that standardized testing pattern definitions and
    recommend testing practices for the enterprise. This accelerated the knowledge sharing required to improve testing
    across the enterprise.
  - Developed self-help playbooks for the common problems teams face with teamwork, work decomposition, testing
    pipeline architecture, and other issues that impact their ability to execute continuous delivery. The playbooks
    became an important force multiplier that allowed the Dojo team to focus on more difficult problems while the common
    problems we resolved in a self-service manner.
  - Designed an innovative self-service technical coaching tool that combines delivery metrics and ways of working
    survey results with gamification to guide teams to better solutions. This allowed teams to find solutions to
    problems they didn't understand they had and reduced the workload for the Dojo team.
  - Designed the CD enterprise scaling strategy to allow more rapid improvement by certifying senior engineers who
    have demonstrated through improved delivery metrics to have improved team outcomes. This horizontally scaled the
    ability to improve the flow of value in multiple organizations without an increase in Platform overhead.

  position: Product Owner

  summary: 'Product owner for Global Platform’s delivery metrics solution using CapitalOne’s Hygieia DevOps dashboard
    with custom visualizations and automation to meet Walmart’s goal of guiding teams to CD good practices.'
  highlights:
  - Brought Walmart into partnership with CapitalOne and other large enterprise contributors to Hygieia to establish the Hygieia open source consortium.
  - Developed the scoring standards for each instrumented development activity to encourage the behaviors that align with our enterprise goals.
  - Worked with platform customers to build team and leadership chain dashboards to aggregate pipeline data and improve the gamification to give a better picture of how teams work.
  - Expanded the user base of Hygieia from less than 20% of teams to more than 80% of teams in less than 6 months with automated metric platform onboarding, resulting in more frequent requests for information on how to improve scores and the need to establish a DevOps Dojo.

  position: Systems Architect

  summary: 'Tiger team member responsible for establishing the techniques and behaviors required for teams to
    migrate to continuous delivery workflows. Collaborated with the Logistics platform team to grow tools and
    processes together to ensure each reinforced the goals of CD.'
  highlights:
  - Defined product domains and product team alignment to sub-domains for the NextGen WMS. This resulted in teams that could collaborate through interfaces and deliver independently.
  - Defined the CD capability dependency tree to help inform the path for teams piloting continuous delivery. This was used to inform our roadmap for the CD core team’s behavior and automation efforts.
  - Created the testing terms glossary and patterns guide to help teams learn to test and to use a common language.
  - Led the first team focusing on continuous delivery to find good techniques for upskilling teams. This resulted in growing a typical team from quarterly delivery to nearly one delivery per day per developer over the course of 9 months.

  position: Systems Architect
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Responsible for integrating over 400 feature branches for the quarterly delivery of Walmart’s global warehouse management system. Given responsibility for developing better processes that would make the team unnecessary.'
  highlights:
  - Automated the branching process to branch more than 800 SVN repositories and create Ant Hill Pro build
    configurations. This reduced the lead time for branch creation from 48 hours to 90 minutes, made it a self-service
    activity instead of controlled by the Source team, and saved over 96 hours of effort for each feature branch for 400
    development teams.
  - Changed the branching model for the area to reduce the number of long-lived branches from more than
    400 to 2. This enabled the dissolution of the source management team.
