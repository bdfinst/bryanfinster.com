  position: Architect, Product Owner
  website: walmart.com
  startDate: '2018-01'
  endDate: ''
  summary: 'Founded the Walmart DevOps Dojo. Responsible for defining
    the techniques for helping product teams worldwide learn the principles
    and practices of continuous delivery and working with executive leadership to
    coordinate efforts. Develop training and presentations to help
    teams with every aspect of delivery, from idea to production. Work with Platform
    leadership to inform changes to the platform to reinforce good practices, improve
    security and compliance, and enhance the developer experience.'
  highlights:
  - I was challenged to find effective ways to improve software delivery processes for nearly
    2000 development teams worldwide with a small team of passionate Sr. developers. I developed
    a strategy that combined platform delivery metrics, direct team engagement using immersive
    learning techniques, and standardized self-guided playbooks based on the lessons learned
    from the engagements. This combination allowed us to indirectly help many more teams by
    showing them how to measure improvement and provide easy to consume information on how to
    improve multiple aspects of delivery. Teams we worked with directly typically doubled their
    throughput, improved quality, and reduced team stress and toil.
  - To help more teams in self-improvement, we needed a way to both encourage teams to
    measurably improve and to give them the information for their next improvement step that
    they may not even know they needed. We built an application that combined platform delivery
    metrics with a short "ways of working" survey. Using that data, we were able to add
    gamification to encourage the desire to improve and direct them to the information for how
    to improve on items they would not have known how to search for. This "Coaching as a
    Service" tool became an invaluable reverse search engine and was very well received by the
    teams.
  - To further scale our efforts without incurring the overhead of a large increase in Dojo team
    size, we needed a process to teach our techniques to other engineering leads in every line
    of business. We also needed to make sure that the quality for the improvement projects was
    maintained to our standrds. I developed a strategy of self-certifying practitioners. Level 1
    for thouse who pass a certification test that they have knowledge of the core concepts
    required for improving the flow of delivery, from idea to production. Level 2 for those who
    demonstrate through an improvement project that they have the leadership and technical
    ability to help a team improve delivery outcomes. Level 3 for those who demonstrate the
    ability to grow more leaders. This resulted in horizontal scaling of flow improvement as a
    capability and made those helping teams change excited that they finally understood how to
    use a scientific approach to improvement instead of trying to copy others.
  - Built and supported enterprise communities of interest to improve cross-organizational
    sharing of techniques for all aspects of development. This resulted in a horizontal scaling
    of knowledge and effectively grew the capabilities of the Dojo team.
  - Metrics were being used in wildly different ways in each org, sometimes destructively.
    Metrics are key to the success of any improvement effort and the lack of unity was an
    impediment to the Dojo`s goals. To mitigate this I formed a cross-organizational effort by
    bringing leaders from each area together to standardize the definitiations and usage of
    enterprise delivery metrics which resulted in a common approach to effectively measure
    efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of software delivery for the enterprise.
  - Testing and test architecture is core to the success to any improvement of delivery.
    Unfortunately, there are no industry common terms to define each pattern. I helped form
    a coalition of Sr. developers so we could define standard terms for testing patterns and
    good practices for how to use them. This enabled the scaling of testing knowledge and
    techniques globally.

  summary: 'Product owner for Global Platform’s delivery metrics dashboard designed to meet Walmart’s goal of guiding
  teams to good continuous delivery practices. '
  highlights:
  - As part of the effort to establish a global platform to enable continuous delivery, we
    needed a method to indicate to teams that they were not using the platform with CD
    practices. Using an existing open source DevOps metrics dashboard, we added gamification to
    show where practices did not match the goals of CD. We also added automation to generate
    dashboards for any team who used the platform. This led to early adopters asking my team for
    assistance to improve the scores by moving closer to daily production delivery. The volume
    of customer requests led to management request for me to start a dedicated DevOps Dojo.

  position: Systems Architect
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Responsible for exploring the techniques, and behaviors required to execute
    continuous delivery workflows using the developing Logistics CD platform. '
  highlights:
  - There was a challenge from Logistics management to accelerate delivery cadence from once per
    quarter to once every two weeks. While the Platform was being built, I was responsible for
    discovering the practices and coding techniques teams needed to use the delivery platform
    effectively. I also led the effort to define the new team / product domain structure to
    enable a loosly coupled architecture. Using on e of the new teams as a pilot, we discovered
    the effectiveness of reducing batch size, using continuous integration practices,  and
    focusing on team outcomes instead of individual deliverables to accelerate delivery. This
    allowed the team to increase delivery cadence from quarterly to several times per day
    and exceeding the request from management by several orders of magnitude over a 9 month
    period.

  summary: 'Responsible for integrating over 400 feature branches for the quarterly release of
    Walmart’s global warehouse management system with the mandate to develop better processes
    that would make the team unnecessary.'
  highlights:
  - I was placed on the source management team to find ways to reduce the expense and time
    delays caused by having
    a single team responsbible for merging from multiple project teams. The team was
    also responsible for creating source branches as required for each of the development teams.
    This effort required two developer for a minimum of 2 days and resulted in a 48 hour lead
    time for the development team to start work. I created scripts to automate the braching and
    build configuration for the 800+ applications that the system used. This effort resulted in
    a reduction of lead time from 48 hours to 90 minutes and became a self-service process. In
    addition, I changed the operating model to require team to resolve their own merge
    conflicts. I also introduced concepts from continuous integration and trunk-based
    development. These operating changes reduced the number of permanant branches from over 400
    to 3 and removed the need for a source management team.

  highlights:
  - 'There were multiple unrelated systems running in distribution centers worldwide. To improve
    the ability to implement changes while reducing duplication, it was decided to take four of
    the most used systems and merge their capabilities. I was responsible for working with
    business stakeholders to define requirements for the common modules, reviewing designs,
    defining coding standards, mapping data models between four systems to a common model, and
    code review. The result was a system that was able to grow to meet the needs of an
    omni-channel supply chain and remove the duplication of efforts in each market. '
