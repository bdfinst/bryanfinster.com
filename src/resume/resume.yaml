  position: Product Owner, Architect

  startDate: '2018-01'
  endDate: ''
  summary: 'Founded the Walmart DevOps Dojo. Responsible for defining
    the techniques for helping product teams worldwide learn the principles
    and practices of continuous delivery. Developed training and presentations to help
    teams with every aspect of delivery, from idea to production. Worked with Platform
    leadership to design changes to the platform to reinforce good practices, improve
    security and compliance, and improve the developer experience.'
  highlights:
  - Lead the cross-organizational effort to standardize enterprise delivery metrics which
    resulted in a common approach to effectively measure efficiency, effectiveness, and
    sustainability of software delivery for the enterprise.
  - Helped standardize testing pattern definitions and good practices. This enabled the
    scaling of testing knowledge and techniques globally.
  - Built and supported enterprise communities of interest to improve cross-organizational
    sharing of techniques for all aspects of development. This resulted in a horizontal scaling
    of knowledge and effectively grew the capabilities of the Dojo team.
  - Developed self-help playbooks for the common issues teams face when migrating to a
    continuous delivery development flow. These playbooks were a force multiplier that allowed
    the Dojo team to focus on helping with more complicated problems while providing actionable
    improvement journeys for teams starting the journey.
  - Designed a "Coaching as a Service" tool that combined pipeline delivery metrics and
    "ways of working" survey results to guide teams to improvement playbooks. This became an
    important tool to help teams find solutions to problem they didn't know they had without
    the expense of direct observation by the dojo team.
  - Designed the current enterprise scaling strategy to allow more rapid improvement
    by certifying senior engineers who have demonstrated the ability to help team measurably
    improve delivery outcomes.

  summary: 'Product owner for Global Platform’s delivery metrics solution using CapitalOne’s Hygieia DevOps dashboard
    with custom visualizations and automation to meet Walmart’s goal of guiding teams to CD good practices.'
  highlights:
  - Brought Walmart into partnership with CapitalOne and other large enterprise contributors to Hygieia to establish the Hygieia open source consortium.
  - Developed the scoring standards for each instrumented development activity to encourage the behaviors that align with our enterprise goals.
  - Worked with platform customers to build team and leadership chain dashboards to aggregate pipeline data and improve the gamification to give a better picture of how teams work.
  - Expanded the user base of Hygieia from less than 20% of teams to more than 80% of teams in less than 6 months with automated metric platform onboarding, resulting in more frequent requests for information on how to improve scores and the need to establish a DevOps Dojo.

  position: Systems Architect

  summary: 'Tiger team member responsible for establishing the techniques and behaviors required for teams to
    migrate to continuous delivery workflows. Collaborated with the Logistics platform team to grow tools and
    processes together to ensure each reinforced the goals of CD.'
  highlights:
  - Defined product domains and product team alignment to sub-domains for the NextGen WMS. This resulted in teams that could collaborate through interfaces and deliver independently.
  - Defined the CD capability dependency tree to help inform the path for teams piloting continuous delivery. This was used to inform our roadmap for the CD core team’s behavior and automation efforts.
  - Created the testing terms glossary and patterns guide to help teams learn to test and to use a common language.
  - Led the first team focusing on continuous delivery to find good techniques for upskilling teams. This resulted in growing a typical team from quarterly delivery to nearly one delivery per day per developer over the course of 9 months.

  description: Logistics Systems Source Management Team
  position: Systems Architect
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Responsible for integrating over 400 feature branches for the quarterly delivery of Walmart’s global warehouse management system. Given responsibility for developing better processes that would make the team unnecessary.'
  highlights:
  - Automated the branching process to branch more than 800 SVN repositories and create Ant Hill Pro build
    configurations. This reduced the lead time for branch creation from 48 hours to 90 minutes, made it a self-service
    activity instead of controlled by the Source team, and saved over 96 hours of effort for each feature branch for 400
    development teams.
  - Changed the branching model for the area to reduce the number of long-lived branches from more than
    400 to 2. This enabled the dissolution of the source management team.
