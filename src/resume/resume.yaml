  description: 'Developer Productivity - DevOps Dojo'
  position: Product Owner, Architect
  website: walmart.com
  startDate: '2018-01'
  endDate: ''
  summary: 'Founded the Walmart DevOps Dojo. Responsible for defining
    the techniques for helping product teams worldwide learn the principles
    and practices of continuous delivery and working with executive leadership to
    coordinate efforts. Developed training and presentations to help
    teams with every aspect of delivery, from idea to production. Worked with Platform
    leadership to design changes to the platform to reinforce good practices, improve
    security and compliance, and improve the developer experience.'
  highlights:
  - Lead the cross-organizational effort to standardize enterprise delivery metrics which
    resulted in a common approach to effectively measure efficiency, effectiveness, and
    sustainability of software delivery for the enterprise.
  - Helped standardize testing pattern definitions and good practices. This enabled the
    scaling of testing knowledge and techniques globally.
  - Built and supported enterprise communities of interest to improve cross-organizational
    sharing of techniques for all aspects of development. This resulted in a horizontal scaling
    of knowledge and effectively grew the capabilities of the Dojo team.
  - Developed self-help playbooks for the common issues teams face when migrating to a
    continuous delivery development flow. These playbooks were a force multiplier that allowed
    the Dojo team to focus on helping with more complicated problems while providing actionable
    improvement journeys for teams starting the journey.
  - Designed a "Coaching as a Service" tool that combined pipeline delivery metrics and
    "ways of working" survey results to guide teams to improvement playbooks. This became an
    important tool to help teams find solutions to problem they didn't know they had without
    the expense of direct observation by the dojo team.
  - Designed the current enterprise scaling strategy to allow more rapid improvement
    by certifying senior engineers who have demonstrated the ability to help team measurably
    improve delivery outcomes.

  position: Product Owner
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Product owner for Global Platform’s delivery metrics solution using CapitalOne’s Hygieia DevOps dashboard.
  with custom visualizations and automation to meet Walmart’s goal of guiding teams to CD good practices. '
  highlights:
  - Scoring teams based on good practices for continuous delivery resulted in immediate
    requests for information on how to execute better. This resulted in enough demand from
    early adopter teams that I was asked to build an enterprise Dojo to meet the need.
  - Worked with platform customers to build team, product, and leadership dashboards to
    aggregate pipeline data. This allowed improved observability to development flow for all
    levels of the organization and increased requests for tips to improve.
  - Expanded the user base of Hygieia from less than 20% of teams to more than 80% of teams
    in less than 6 months with automated dashboard onboarding.

  position: Systems Architect
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Member of the core team responsible for exploring the tools, techniques, and
    behaviors required to execute continuous delivery workflows. '
  highlights:
  - Defined product domains and product team structure for the NextGen WMS. This resulted
    in loosly coupled, cross-functional teams that could deliver independently and on-demand.
  - Led the first team focusing on continuous delivery to find good techniques for upskilling
    teams. This resulted in growing a normal team from 1 delivery per quarter to a sustainable
    flow of multiple deliveries per day with a peak of 12 per day from team of 13 engineers.

  description: Logistics Systems Source Management Team
  position: Systems Architect
  website: walmart.com
  summary: 'Responsible for integrating over 400 feature branches for the quarterly release of
    Walmart’s global warehouse management system with the mandate to develop better processes
    that would make the team unnecessary.'
  highlights:
  - Automated the branching and build configuration process for more than 800 SVN repositories.
    This reduced the lead time for branch creation from 48 hours to 90 minutes, made it a
    self-service activity instead of controlled by the Source team, and saved over 96 hours
    of manual effort for each feature branch for 400 development teams.
  - Changed the branching model for the area to reduce the number of long-lived branches from
    more than 400 to 2. This greatly simplified code integration and enabled the source
    management team to be obsoleted.

    This enabled faster issue resolution, application performance monitoring, and reduced
